    <h2>Inspection</h2>
    <p>As part of a residential real estate transaction (buying or selling a home, whether a single-family home, a duplex, or even an entire apartment complex, we can inspect the primary buildings (out buildings extra) for any and all kinds of wood destroying insects.</p>
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the main house, itself</li>
      <li>the crawl space beneath the house, if built on a pier &amp; beam foundation</li>
      <li>attic spaces</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="treatment">
    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>If any evidence of previous or current infestation is found, we can provide complete treatment that will destroy not only the visible bugs, but also destroy any colonies from which they base their invasion.</p>
    <p>Our treatments include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>spraying the eaves and outside of the home</li>
      <li>rodding, which injects insecticides into the ground around your home, creating a barrier to prevent future infestations</li>
      <li>drilling may be required to ensure a complete barrier and is a minimally invasive process</li>
    </ul>
